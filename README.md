# Short Group Project for CS445 Spring 2019
Group members consist of Jaden Drury and Chris Wilson.

Our main implementation goal is to allow a user to select "tags" or "filters" when searching in the DOMA database. This will allow them to search categorically, narrowing search results with something broader instead of specifically name only.
